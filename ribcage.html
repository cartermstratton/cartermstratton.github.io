									<h1>Medical School Thoracotomy Model <br />
									</h1>
									<p>This project was completed while volunteering with the Medical School 3D Printing Lab at the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). </p>

								<p><b>Project Goal: </b>Design a 3D printed model to be used by medical school student to practice performing a thoracotomy surgery.</p>
								<p><b>Responsibility: </b> I was tasked with the entire completion of this project, completing all design and modelling. </p>
								<p><b>Final Design: </b>Shown in the above image is the complete SolidWorks model of the thoracotomy surgery model. The white/grey parts will be printed out of a hard plastic (PLA) to represent the bones and the blue parts will be printed out of a flexible plastic (TPU) to mimic both the cartilage between the ribs and sternum and the flexibility of the spine. As the spine is not directly effected during a thoracotomy surgery, it was easier to replace the entire spine with one flexible piece to make the model more simple and easier to manufacture. </p>
								<p>Initially, I developed a SolidWorks model of the human upper body using downloaded rub, sternum, vertebrae disc and cartilage 3D files that were crated using 3D medical imaging technology, shown below.<p>

                                            .image-top img {

                                                height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
                                            }
                                        
                                            .image-container {
                                                display: flex;
                                                justify-content: center; /* Center images horizontally */
                                                align-items: center; /* Center images vertically */
                                                gap: 10px; /* Space between images */
                                                margin: 0 auto; /* Center the container itself */
                                            }
                                        
                                            .image.main img {
                                                width: 75%; /* Adjust the size of the images */
                                                height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
                                            }
                                        </style>
                                <p>I then designed specialized connectors and encoprporated these connectors into the model to allow for ease of manufacturing and assembky, while ensuring the flexibility of the rib cage remained similar to the human body. The designed connector is shown below and is made of a flexible TPU. </p>

								<p><b>Actions: </b>Listed below are all the tasks I completed for this Project</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Consulted with Medical School 3D Printing Lab manager to discuss the project and determine project requirements.</li>
									<li>Modified downloaded upper body part 3D mesh files using Blender and MeshMixer to reduce complexity of the mesh files while maintaining overall shape. </li>
									<li>Analyzed anthropometric data of human rib and vertebrae discs using Microsoft Excel to determine necessary sizes of downloaded upper body parts to accurately mimic the size of the average male upper body. </li>
									<li>Developed human upper body model using SolidWorks</li>
									<li>Developed thoracotomy surgery model using SolidWorks, encorporating desgined connectors pieces and modifying body parts.</li>
									<li>Modified parts using Solidworks and Ultimaker Cura to optimize for 3D printing</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>Result: </b> The thoracotomy surgery model is currently being 3D printed from the SolidWorks model shown above. Once 3D printed, the model will be assembled and used by Medical School students starting in 2025. </p>
