                                <p><b>Project Goal: </b>Design a storage solution for gearbox oil leakage, a required component of the car per FSAE Michigan competition rules.  </p>
                                <p><b>Responsibility: </b>Working alongside another team member, we were tasked with designing and manufacturing the part. </p>
                                <p><b>Final Design: </b>Shown in the above photo is the Catch Can on our 2023 competition car. </p>
								<p><b>Actions: </b>Listed below are all the tasks I completed for this project:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Designed the catch can design using SolidWorks (figure 1).</li>
                                    <li>Designed the catch can frame mounting brackets using SolidWorks (figure 1).</li>
                                    <li>Manufactured the catch can and catch can frame mounting parts using a water jet cutter (Figures 2 and 3).</li>
								</ul>

                                <p><b>Result: </b>The Catch Can was installed on the 2023 competition car and used in competition. The Catch Can passed mechanical inspection at competition, meeting all rules and requirements. The Catch Can performed as a storage solution for gearbox leakage at competition and did not present any flaws.  <p>
