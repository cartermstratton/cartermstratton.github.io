                                <p>For confidentiality reasons, I cannot provide any images, drawings, client names or project locations for work completed during this project and can only show select SolidWorks model screenshots.  </p>
                                <p><b>Project Goal: </b>Design a lifting frame to lift a 2-meter tall, 1 meter diameter, 7 tonne Manage Pressure Drilling (MPD) unit onto the Blowout Preventer (BOP) that is located on the drilling floor of an offshore oil production facility. </p>
                                <p><b>Responsibility: </b>I was tasked with completing all design and SolidWorks modelling for this project. </p>
                                <p><b>Final Design: </b> Shown in the above is the final assembly containing the MPD unit in grey and the designed lifting frame in yellow. </p>
								<p><b>Actions: </b>Listed below are all the tasks I completed for this project:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Analyzed engineering drawings and provided 3D model of MPD unit using SolidWorks and AutoCAD.</li>
									<li>Analyzed the drilling floor and Blowout Preventer of the offshore oil production facility in Navisworks to identify lifting frame interface points and overall environment layout.</li>
									<li>Created a SolidWorks model for the MPD unit lift frame</li>
									<li>Developed engineering drawings of the MPD unit lift frame for manufacturing</li>
									<li>Created presentations for client meetings and presented the concept and project progress at various stages of the project.</li>
                                    <li>Collaborated with structural engineers to review Finite Element Analysis (FEA) data to ensure lifting frame met offshore structural lifting standards.</li>
								</ul>
								
                                <p><b>Result: </b>The lifting frame was manufactured based on the SolidWorks model and the manufacturing drawings I created. The MPD unit was successfully installed onto the BOP of the offshore oil platform in early 2024.<p>
