								<p><b>Project Description: </b>The goal of the project was to develop a 3D printed model that could be used by medical school students to practice a 
									thoractomoty surgery.
									A thoracotomy involves locating the ribs, making an incision in the skin, separating the ribs to access the lungs and performing surgery on the lungs. </p>
								<p><b>Task: </b> Volunteering with the Medical School 3D printing lab. I was tasked with managing this project and completing all 
									design and SolidWorks modelling of the model. </p>
								<p><b>Action: </b> Shown in the above image is the completed SolidWorks model of the thoracotomy surgery model. Initially, I developed a SolidWorks model of 
									the human upper body using downloaded rib, sternum, vertebrae disc and cartilage 3D files that were created using medical imaging technology. The human upper
									body model was scaled based on anthropometric data to accurately represent the average male humans rib cage size. 
									 The thoracotomy surgery model was then 
									desgined based on the 
									human upper body model, encorporating necessary components and making modifications to allow for the model to be easily 3D printed and assembled while also
									ensuring the positioning of the ribs, sternum and spine remained.
									In the final SolidWorks model of the thoracotomy sugery model shown above, the white parts will be 3D printed from PLA and the light blue parts will be 3D printed 
									from a flexible TPU to ensure the model perform similar to the human rib cage.   </p>
								<p><b>Result: </b> The thoracotomy surgery model is currently being 3D printed from the SolidWorks model shown above. Once all 3D printing is complete, the 
								model will be assembled and used by Medical School students starting in 2025. </p>
