								<p>For confidentiality reasons, I cannot provide any images, drawings, client names or project locations for work completed during this project and can only show select SolidWorks model screenshots.  </p>
                                <p><b>Project Goal: </b>Design a device to be installed onto existing subsea radio transponders to ensure the radio transponders do not detach from the mooring chains and mooring chain interfaces of an offshore Floating, Production, Storage and Operations Vessel (FPSO). The design must be operated using a subsea Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) and allow for the easy installation and removal of the radio transponders.   </p>
                                <p><b>Responsibility: </b>I was tasked with completing all design and SolidWorks modelling for this project, managing the overall completion of the project. </p>
                                <p><b>Final Design: </b> Shown in the below image is the final assembly containing the mooring chain interface (outer yellow part containing flange on the left), the radio transponder (black), the radio transponder sleeve (inner yellow and orange part) and the designed transponder retention device (grey). The radio transponder sleeve is directly attached to the radio transponder and slides into the mooring chain interface. The transponder retention device is designed to work in one motion with the use of a subsea ROV, swinging in the arm and locking the arm in place with the sliding collar, ensuring the radio transponder sleeve and mooring chain interface are connected and cannot detach. </p>

								<p><b>Actions: </b>Listed below are all the tasks I completed for this project:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Analyzed engineering drawings and subsea ROV footage of existing subsea radio transponders.</li>
									<li>Created a SolidWorks 3D model of the existing radio transponder and radio transponder mooring chain interface based on client engineering drawings.</li>
									<li>Developed multiple transponder retention device concepts in SolidWorks.</li>
									<li>Presented transponder device concepts to client engineers and Frontier engineers, collaboratively determining the best transponder retention device shown in the above figure. </li>
									<li>Created engineering manufacturing drawing of transponder retention device.</li>
								</ul>
								
                                <p><b>Result: </b>At the end of my work term, the device was being manufactured based on the manufacturing drawing I created. Once manufactured, the device was to be tested on an existing radio transponder sleeve and mooring chain interface  on shore before being implemented subsea.  </p>
