									<h1>Push Rod Rear Suspension Design <br />
									</h1>
									<p>This Project was completed as a suspension subteam member at the UBC Formula Electric Design Team. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image-top"><img src="images/sus.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><b>Project Goal: </b>Redesign the rear suspension to allow for the addition of in-hub motors onto the car. </p>
								<p><b>Responsibility: </b>I was tasked with managing this project, involving determening the layout and pakcaging of the suspension system, design all components and manufacturing components </p>
								<p><b>Final Design: </b>Shown in the above figure is the rear suspension on our 2024 formula car at competition. The design is a push-rod suspension design encorporating a bell crank, shock, push rod and an anti roll bar (ARB).  </p>
